There was an old owl that lived in an oak. Everyday it saw incidents happening around it. It saw a boy helping an old man to carry a heavy basket yesterday. Today it saw a girl shouting at her mother. The more it saw the less it spoke. As it spoke less, it heard more. It heard people talking and telling stories. It heard a woman saying that an elephant jumped over a fence. It also heard a man saying that he had never made a mistake. The old owl had seen and heard about what happened to people. Some became better and some became worse. But the old owl had become wiser each and every day.
