Once upon a time, there was a fox. One day the fox went for a walk. He came to an orchard filled with grape vines. "These grapes look so good!" he said out loud. He decided to eat some because he was hungry. But the grapes were very high above his head. The fox jumped for the grapes. He could not reach them. Because they looked so good to eat, the fox wanted them badly. He decided to try again. This time he ran and jumped. He missed again. The fox was getting tired. But he tried again... And again he missed. Angry he walked away. "Those grapes are sour anyway", he mumbled as he walked away.
